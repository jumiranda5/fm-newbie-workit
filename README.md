## Useful resources

- [MDN - Counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_counter_styles/Using_CSS_counters) - I decided to use an ```ol``` , but to style the number I had to remove the list-style-type, so I used counters.
- [MDN - clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) - I used clip-path for the rounded containers.
